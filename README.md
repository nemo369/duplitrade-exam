## About The Exam

1. Head over to our homepage at www.duplitrade.com and rewrite it as you see fit. You 
may use any js framework (encouraged) and css to help you with this. 
  ○ Keep in mind that the design should be as flexible as possible as if it were to serve the whole website. 
  ○ You don’t have to implement the whole homepage. Below is the image of the desired components we wish to see. 
2. Given this picture, please write a small piece of code that will receive data from an api (can just be static data pulled from a file or just returned from a tiny node app) and show this table. 
  ● The Duplicate button should have an action attached to it that does nothing. 
  ● Net P/L % column shows green for positive values and black for negative values 
  ● Followers column is sortable
